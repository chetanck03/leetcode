# LeetCode Solutions

Welcome to my LeetCode Solutions repository! This project is a collection of my solutions to various LeetCode problems, solved daily. This repository is intended to track my progress, share my approach to problem-solving, and provide useful solutions to others.

## Overview

- **Daily Solutions:** Solutions to problems I tackle each day, organized by date.
- **Problem Categories:** Solutions categorized by problem type (e.g., Arrays, Strings, Trees).
- **Languages:** Solutions are primarily in Java , but you may find solutions in other languages as well.

## Problem-Solving Approach

For each problem, I follow a structured approach:

1. **Understanding the Problem:** Analyzing the problem statement and constraints.
2. **Designing the Solution:** Planning the algorithm and data structures to use.
3. **Implementing the Solution:** Writing the code in a clean and efficient manner.
4. **Testing:** Ensuring the solution works with different edge cases and inputs.
5. **Optimization:** Refining the code for better performance if needed.

## How to Use

1. **Clone the Repository:**

```
git clone https://github.com/chetanck03/leetcode.git
```

2. **Navigate to the Solution:**

Each problem's solution is stored in a folder named after the problem title.

3. **Run the Code:**

Instructions to run the code can usually be found within each solutionâ€™s folder. Please refer to the specific instructions provided in each folder to run the respective code.

4. **View Examples:**

Check the `readme.md` file within each solution's folder for example inputs and outputs. This file provides a set of test cases to help you understand how the solution works.
