# Overview

The "Max Consecutive Ones" problem involves finding the maximum number of consecutive 1's in a given binary array. The solution requires iterating through the array while keeping track of the current streak of consecutive 1's and updating the maximum streak found.

The algorithm can be summarized as follows:

1. Initialize two variables: `count` for the current streak of 1's and `max` for the maximum streak.
2. Traverse the array:
   - Increment `count` for each 1 encountered.
   - Update `max` and reset `count` to 0 when a 0 is encountered.
3. After the loop, update `max` to account for a streak of 1's at the end of the array.
4. Return `max`.

This approach ensures an efficient solution with a time complexity of O(n) and a space complexity of O(1).
